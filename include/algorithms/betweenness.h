 * @brief Run Brandes' algorithm to compute betweenness centrality upon the

 * threads specified is less than or equal to 1. The function will spawn 
 * num_threads threads otherwise. The verbose flag determines whether to print 
 * out the status of each thread of the function spawns after increments of 
 * work. If the function spawns multiple threads, the main thread will remain 
 * idle and wait for the other threads to complete their work. Then, the main
 * thread will join the results of each thread and return the final result.
 * 
 * If this function runs with a single thread, it will call Dijkstra's algorithm
 * as used in Brandes' algorithm once for each vertex in the graph sequentially.
 * If this function runs with multiple threads, each spawned thread will call
 * Dijkstra's algorithm on a subset of the set of vertices in the given graph.
 * The number of calls to Dijkstra's algorithm will be roughly equal among 
 * threads. In order to avoid data races when accessing and modifying the 
 * internal state of the graph, the function makes a copy of the graph for each
 * thread spawned. These graph copies are deleted after the thread using them 
 * finishes.
