 * @brief Run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a single

 * graph with the shortest distance to the vertex from the given starting 
 * vertex. It will also save each vertex' predecessor in the shortest path to 
 * the vertex so that the shortest path to some arbitary vertex may be recovered 
 * by backtracking to the starting vertex.
 * 
 * @param g a Graph* indicating the graph with which to find the shortest path 
 * from the given starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
 * @param start a Vertex* indicating the start vertex from which we are find all 
 * of the shortest paths to all other nodes in the given graph.
