# Final Project Proposal (neilk3-akulg3-amaanmk2-amantk2)

1. **Leading Question** <br /> With the rapidly growing market capitalizations of cryptocurrencies and the promise of Web3, decentralized applications, and the future of decentralized computation on blockchain networks, we seek to analyze and understand the pros and cons of the first popular Turing Complete blockchain - Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We will examine several facets of the network, particularly testing the decentralization narrative by identifying individuals that seem to be disproportionately central to the transactions passing through the network. We will examine the shape of the flow of currency through the system to understand how tightly connected any two individuals are by networks of payments. 

2. **Dataset Acquistion and Processing** <br /> Our publicly accessible dataset will be Ethereum Network Transactions gathered from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/bigquery/ethereum-blockchain?select=transactions). Based on this dataset we hope to learn... The data includes  

3. **Graph Algorithms** <br /> The graph algorthims that we plan to implement include Betweenness centrality and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. We also plan to implement Depth First Traversal. For Betweenness centrality... For Kruskal's algorithm... What are the inputs you expect each method to take in? What output are you expecting for each method?Our target big O or efficiency benchmark is... 
It will also involve a weighted shortest path algorithm based on Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

4. **Timeline** <br /> Our timeline breakdown consists of four main benchmarks consisting of our Data work, Implementation of BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Betweenness Centrality. The breakdown of the benchmarks including expected dates is illustrated below.
