# CS 225 Data Structures

# Final Project Proposal (neilk3-akulg3-amaanmk2-amantk2)

1. **Leading Question** 

2. **Dataset Acquistion and Processing** Our publicly accessible dataset will be Ethereum Network Transactions gathered from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/bigquery/ethereum-blockchain?select=transactions). Based on this dataset we hope to learn... The data includes  

3. **Graph Algorithms** The graph algorthims that we plan to implement include Betweenness centrality and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. We also plan to implement Depth First Traversal. For Betweenness centrality... For Kruskal's algorithm... What are the inputs you expect each method to take in? What output are you expecting for each method?Our target big O or efficiency benchmark is... 
It will also involve a weighted shortest path algorithm based on Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.
