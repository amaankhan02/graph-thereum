## Week 1 (11/8 - 11/14)

Met to pull etherium data from the blockchain. Discuessed running graph algorithms on a subset of the dataset on EWS and running graph algorithms on a larger dataset on Google Colab. Initialized project structure and copied over template files from cs225 mp repos. 

## Week 2 (11/15 - 11/21)

Met briefly to discuss the important fields of data we will be using in our project. Developed a python notebook to query and save  data from the etherium blockchain. Began developing code to parse and load CSV files in C++.

## Week 3 (11/29 - 12/5)
Met to discuss the work that had been acomplished, challenges faced, issues, and next steps. We were able to parse our data and load in the necessary CSV files. We had also implemented the graph, vertex, and edge classes as well as implemented BFS and the corresponding test cases. We began working on most of dijkstras and are continuing to finish that up along with the test cases.
