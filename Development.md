# Development Log

## Week 1 (11/8 - 11/14)

Met to pull etherium data from the blockchain. Discuessed running graph algorithms on a subset of the dataset on EWS and running graph algorithms on a larger dataset on Google Colab. Initialized project structure and copied over template files from cs225 mp repos. 

## Week 2 (11/15 - 11/21)

Met briefly to discuss the important fields of data we will be using in our project. Developed a python notebook to query and save data from the etherium blockchain. Began developing code to parse and load CSV files in C++.

## Week 3 (11/29 - 12/5)
Met to discuss the work that had been acomplished, challenges faced, issues, and next steps. We were able to parse our data and load in the necessary CSV files. We had also implemented the graph, vertex, and edge classes as well as implemented BFS and the corresponding test cases. We also successfully completed the implementation of Dijkstras shortest path algorithm, wrote several test cases, and proved that the algorithm was working as intended. We begun the implementation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm!

## Week 4 (12/6 - 12/13)
Met to review the work that had been completed and still needed to be finished. We made adjustments to Dijkstras to ensure that it was working efficiently. We also made significant progress with betweeness centrality and are finishing that up along with the necessary tests. We were also able to create visual graphs from running our algorithms to better analyze and assess our data. A histogram and violin chart were created. We also worked on our results file, README file, and our slides for the presentation.
